# speech bubble imessage css

CSS template for reuse shamelessly forked from <https://codepen.io/AllThingsSmitty/pen/jommGQ>

# HTML structure should be like this:

`<div class="imessage"><p class="from-them">It was loud. We just laid there and said “is this an earthquake? I think this is an earthquake.”</p><p class="from-me">Like is this an earthquake just go back to sleep</p></div>`
